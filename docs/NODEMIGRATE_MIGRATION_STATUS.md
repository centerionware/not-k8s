# nodemigrate implementation and integration status

Last updated: 2026-09-24

This is the living implementation status record for the full scope in
[NODEMIGRATION_GOAL.md](NODEMIGRATION_GOAL.md). Capability marks describe code
that exists; verification marks describe evidence from a run. A passing
compile or unit test does not mark a real migration path as verified.

## Migration coverage

| Scenario or behavior | Implementation | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Detect local K3s service, Kine/etcd mode, config, and network settings | Implemented | Unit tests only; targeted CI rerun pending after compiler fixes |
| Detect an upstream control plane and read CIDRs and cluster domain | Implemented | Focused fixture passes after the rooted manifest path correction |
| Identify Cilium and other known CNIs from the active host CNI configuration | Implemented for recognized CNI config names and plugin types | Focused fixture tests passed in [run 35955823452](https://github.com/centerionware/not-k8s/actions/runs/35955823452) |
| Export all discovered API resource pages, including CRDs and add-ons | Implemented | Not yet exercised against a real cluster |
| Carry static hostPath/local PV data and preserve CSI-backed data on the same host | Implemented for host paths; CSI data remains with its local driver | Not yet exercised through a round trip |
| K3s → nodestore with Flannel | Implemented | No real migration run recorded |
| K3s → nodestore with external CNI such as Cilium | Implemented as external-CNI bootstrap and API-resource transfer | No real migration run recorded |
| Upstream Kubernetes → nodestore | Implemented for detected local control planes | No real migration run recorded |
| Join an existing nodestore control plane using nodebootstrap environment settings | Implemented through nodebootstrap join configuration, then a worker bootstrap registers the replacement node | Focused command tests passed in [run 35955823452](https://github.com/centerionware/not-k8s/actions/runs/35955823452); no real replacement-node run recorded |
| Replace an existing nodestore member | Implemented: wait for the replacement Kubernetes node to become Ready, require the learner to be active and caught up through the leader log tail, promote it, verify voter status, then remove the explicitly identified old member. A failed promotion leaves the old member in place; the membership operation is retryable. | Targeted nodestore/nodebootstrap/nodemigrate checks passed in [run 35957212012](https://github.com/centerionware/not-k8s/actions/runs/35957212012), [run 35957207376](https://github.com/centerionware/not-k8s/actions/runs/35957207376), and [run 35957207356](https://github.com/centerionware/not-k8s/actions/runs/35957207356); no real joined replacement run recorded |
| Nodestore → retained K3s | Implemented; target must already be installed locally | No real migration run recorded |
| Nodestore → retained upstream Kubernetes | Implemented; target must already be installed locally | No real migration run recorded |
| Keep source installed and disabled by default | Implemented | No real service-manager cutover run recorded |
| Explicit source uninstall for K3s, kubeadm, or nodebootstrap | Implemented | Not yet exercised; use only in a disposable integration VM |

## Dedicated integration workflow

See the [CI status](NODEMIGRATE_CI_STATUS.md) for test policy and run history.
`.github/workflows/nodemigrate-integration.yml` is a manual, isolated runner
workflow. It builds the combined runtime and standalone migration binary, then
runs `.github/scripts/nodemigrate-integration.sh` once for each starting
distribution:

1. Install K3s or kubeadm Kubernetes as the initial source. K3s starts with
   Flannel disabled; both paths install Cilium as the external CNI.
2. Install the repository's real hostPath CSI test driver, cert-manager,
   Traefik, an nginx workload, a static hostPath PV/PVC, and a CSI-backed
   dynamic PVC. A pod writes unique data to both volumes.
3. Verify the source node, add-ons, certificate, ingress route, bound claims,
   volume data, and Cilium DaemonSet/CRD state.
4. Migrate source → nodestore and repeat the same checks against the
   nodebootstrap kubeconfig.
5. Migrate nodestore → the retained source distribution and repeat the checks
   again.
6. Exercise a separate existing-cluster replacement lane: join as a learner,
   wait for the replacement Kubernetes node to become Ready and the learner to
   catch up, promote it, then retire the configured old member ID. The current
   integration script does not yet implement this lane.

The workflow is manual. Do not run it unless the user authorizes
real-cluster/e2e execution. The standard e2e and build gates remain excluded
by the user's current instruction.

Update this table after each implementation or verification change. Record the
exact SHA, workflow run, source distribution, CNI, and whether each stage
passed, failed, or was skipped.

The integration workflow currently defaults to K3s `v1.35.0+k3s1`, Cilium
`1.20.2`, cert-manager `v1.21.2`, and Helm `v3.17.3`. The kubeadm lane follows
the Kubernetes stable minor at dispatch time. Override the pinned values with
the workflow environment when testing a different compatibility combination,
and record the resolved versions in the run log.
