# nodemigrate CI and integration status

Last updated: 2026-09-24

This is the living CI record for the scope in
[NODEMIGRATION_GOAL.md](NODEMIGRATION_GOAL.md). The user-specific testing policy
is recorded there and overrides conflicting general `AGENTS.md` gates for
this objective.

## Workflow

- `.github/workflows/nodemigrate-integration.yml` runs shell syntax validation
  on relevant pull requests.
- Manual `workflow_dispatch` starts isolated K3s and upstream Kubernetes
  lanes. Each lane builds the combined runtime binary and standalone
  `nodemigrate` binary as test setup, then runs
  `.github/scripts/nodemigrate-integration.sh` as root and uploads its log.
- The script installs the selected upstream distribution first, uses Cilium
  with Flannel disabled in the K3s lane, installs the hostPath CSI test
  driver, cert-manager, Traefik, nginx, static and CSI-backed claims, then
  checks the source → nodestore → retained-source round trip. Every checkpoint
  asserts the Cilium DaemonSet rollout and CiliumEndpoint CRD are present.
- Every checkpoint now writes a private canonical snapshot of node names and
  roles, workload and ingress specs, PV/PVC bindings, add-on deployments,
  Cilium daemonset images and readiness, required CRD schemas, and
  storage-class configuration. The returned snapshot must match the initial
  one. The migration Certificate secret is compared by digest, without writing
  secret data to logs or checkpoint files.
- Runtime coverage for joining an existing cluster and replacing a member is
  a separate required scenario; the current script does not establish that
  case as verified.

## Required merge gates

Nodemigrate needs both isolated round trips green before merge:

- Single-node K3s with Cilium → not-k8s → K3s, with no differences in the
  checked cluster state, workload behavior, add-ons, ingress, certificates,
  persistent data, or Cilium health between initial and returned checkpoints.
- Upstream Kubernetes with three control-plane nodes and two worker nodes →
  not-k8s → upstream Kubernetes, with all node membership and the same
  workload, add-on, ingress, certificate, persistent-data, and Cilium checks.
  Include the existing-cluster join/replacement path.

QEMU or another isolation mechanism may host the cluster lanes on one CI node.
Docker remains a candidate only after the test setup proves it models the
networking, node identity, service management, storage, and failure behavior
under test. Record the simulator and its limitations with the results. The
current integration workflow does not yet implement or pass these full merge
gates.

## Run policy

- General `build.yml`: excluded by the user for this task.
- General e2e workflow: excluded by the user for this task.
- Local Cargo build/test/e2e: prohibited by repository host constraints.
- Targeted `nodemigrate checks`: the focused compile and test check for
  nodemigrate Rust changes. `quick-check.yml` does not currently include the
  nodemigrate crate; use `components=nodebootstrap` when nodebootstrap changes
  and `components=nodestore` when Raft membership code changes. Run the
  applicable focused checks for every changed crate; do not run unrelated
  crates.
- Dedicated migration workflow: do not dispatch until the user authorizes
  migration runtime/e2e execution. Its compile step is test setup, not a
  generic build gate.
- Static shell syntax, formatting, diff whitespace, and docs-link checks are
  allowed and must be reported separately from runtime evidence.

Kubernetes/K3s/Cilium/add-on versions, and pass/fail state at each checkpoint.
Keep failures and skipped checks visible rather than replacing them with a
later green run.
